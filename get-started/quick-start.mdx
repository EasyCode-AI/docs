---

This quickstart guide will walk you through building a full stack app using EasyCode Flow's core features. By the end, you will be familiar with the end to end process from planning to deployment.

<Info>
  **Prerequisites**: If you haven't installed and set up the IDE, please follow the [Installation Guide](./installation.mdx)
</Info>

As an example, we will use the following app idea:

> ```
> Build a notes app with user authentication
> ```

## 1. Plan your app

<Frame>
  <video
    controls
    className="w-full h-full rounded-xl"
    src="/images/quick-start/planning.mp4"
  >
    Your browser does not support the video tag. This video demonstrates the planning step in EasyCode Flow.
  </video>
</Frame>

- Enter app idea
- Give app name
- Review the plan
- **Accept**, **Reject**, or **Chat** to modify the plan

<Tip>
  If you alraedy have a detailed PRD, you can copy and paste the PRD into the initial prompt and EasyCode will break it down to logical steps. 
</Tip>

## 2. Build the first screen

<Frame>
  <video
    controls
    className="w-full h-full rounded-xl"
    src="/images/quick-start/frontend.mp4"
  >
    Your browser does not support the video tag. This video shows the process of building the first screen in EasyCode Flow.
  </video>
</Frame>

- Approve agent's context selection
- Wait for code changes to finish
- Click **Open App** to inspect the app inside EasyCode Browser
- **Chat** to make adjustment or **Start Next Step**

<Tip>
  The app is still a mock up at this stage, core functionalities are likely not implemented yet and will be added during later steps. 
</Tip>

## 3. Connect Supabase

<Frame>
  <video
    controls
    className="w-full h-full rounded-xl"
    src="/images/quick-start/supabase.mp4"
  >
    Your browser does not support the video tag. This video demonstrates connecting Supabase to your project.
  </video>
</Frame>

- Connect to your Supabase
- Approve access to organization
- Return to EasyCode Flow and **create a new project**. 
- Approve Supabase changes

<Warning>
  Currently we only integrate with new Supabase projects. If you'd like to use your existing Supabase project, let us know here and you will be the first to know when it becomes available. 
</Warning>

## 4. Deploy your app

<Frame>
  <video
    controls
    className="w-full h-full rounded-xl"
    src="/images/quick-start/deploy.mp4"
  >
    Your browser does not support the video tag. This video demonstrates deploying your app with EasyCode Flow.
  </video>
</Frame>

## Common Problems

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I cannot connect my Supabase account.">
    - Make sure you still have available project slots in your Supabase organization. If you are on a free Supabase plan, you will have 2 project slots. 
    - If you already have 2 or more projects, you can pause one of the projects to make room for new projects.

    If all fails, try creating a New Organization in Supabase on a free tier, and click "Connect to Supabase" again from within EasyCode to initiate the access authorization. 
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="My deployment failed.">
    Make sure all linter errors and runtime errors are fixed before trying to deploy. 

    After fixing any remaining errors, initiate deployment again.
