This quickstart guide will walk you through building a full stack app using EasyCode Flow's core features. By the end, you will be familiar with the end to end process from planning to deployment.

<Info>
  **Prerequisites**: If you haven't installed and set up the IDE, please follow the Installation Guide
</Info>

As an example, we will use the following app idea:

> ```
> Build a notes app with user authentication
> ```

## 1. Plan your app

EasyCode assesses your initial prompt and breaks it down into logical steps instead of trying to one-shot the idea. This increases code quality and prevents errors from accumulating.

[images/quick-start/planning.mp4]

- Enter app idea
- Give app name
- Review the plan
- **Accept**, **Reject**, or **Chat** to modify the plan

<Tip>
  If you alraedy have a detailed PRD, you can copy and paste the PRD into the initial prompt and EasyCode will break it down to logical steps. 
</Tip>

## 2. Build the first screen

Once the plan is accepted, the AI will start implementation. The first step will be building out the "main page" of your app so you can confirm it's what you want. 

[images/quick-start/frontend.mp4]

- Approve agent's context selection
- Wait for code changes to finish
- Click **Open App** to inspect the app inside EasyCode Browser
- **Chat** to make adjustment or **Start Next Step**

<Tip>
  The app is still a mock up at this stage, core functionalities are likely not implemented yet and will be added during later steps. 
</Tip>

## 3. Connect Supabase

Since our initial prompt required user authentication, we will need to connect Supabase. When prompted:

[images/quick-start/supabase.mp4]

- Connect to your Supabase
- Approve access to organization
- Return to EasyCode Flow and **create a new project**. 
- Approve Supabase changes

<Warning>
  Currently we only integrate with new Supabase projects. If you'd like to use your existing Supabase project, let us know here and you will be the first to know when it becomes available. 
</Warning>

## Deploy your app

Deployment is easy inside EasyCode. 

[images/quick-start/deploy.mp4]

- Click **Deploy** -\> **Deploy App **in the EasyCode Flow menu bar
- Wait for deployment to complete
- Inspect the deployed URL 

<Info>
  Support for custom domain is coming soon.

## Common Problems

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I cannot connect my Supabase account.">
    - ~~Make~~ sure you still have available project slots in your Supabase organization. If you are on a free Supabase plan, you will have 2 project slots. 
    - If you already have 2 or more projects, you can pause one of the projects to make room for new projects.

    If all fails, try creating a New Organization in Supabase on a free tier, and click "Connect to Supabase" again from within EasyCode to initiate the access authorization. 
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="My deployment failed.">
    Make sure all linter errors and runtime errors are fixed before trying to deploy. 

    After fixing any remaining errors, initiate deployment again.
