## Common Installation Problems

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I cannot download the installer file.">
    Check for any browser notifications. Some brownsers can silently block large files or ask for download permission.

    Try a different browser. Some users who use Brave or Arc have reported issues with downloading the installer. Try using Chrome or Safari.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Installation fails due to errors">
    This is likely caused by NodeJS or Git not being installed correctly. If installation fails after multiple attempls, please try installing NodeJS and Git manually.
