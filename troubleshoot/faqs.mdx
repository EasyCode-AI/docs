## Getting Started

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I get started?">
    Follow the 4-step Quick Start above, or check out the full [Quick Start Guide](../get-started/quick-start) for a detailed walkthrough.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I cannot download the installer file.">
    Check for any browser notifications. Some browsers can silently block large files or ask for download permission.

    Try a different browser. Some users who use Brave or Arc have reported issues with downloading the installer. Try using Chrome or Safari.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Installation fails due to errors">
    This is likely caused by NodeJS or Git not being installed correctly. If installation fails after multiple attempts, please try installing NodeJS and Git manually.

    You can find the official NodeJS and Git installation instructions below:

    - [NodeJS Official Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
    - [Git Official Download](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What are the system requirements?">
    EasyCode Flow requires **NodeJS** and **Git** to function properly. Currently supported platforms:
    - **MacOS**: Apple Silicon (M Series Macs) - Apple Intel not supported right now
    - **Windows**: Windows x64 (Windows arm64 not supported right now)  
    - **Linux**: Currently not supported
  </Accordion>

## Supabase Integration

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I use my own Supabase project?">
    Currently, EasyCode Flow integrates with new Supabase projects. Existing project support is coming soonâ€”let us know if you need early access!
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I cannot connect my Supabase account.">
    - Make sure you still have available project slots in your Supabase organization. If you are on a free Supabase plan, you will have 2 project slots. 
    - If you already have 2 or more projects, you can pause one of the projects to make room for new projects.

    If all fails, try creating a New Organization in Supabase on a free tier, and click "Connect to Supabase" again from within EasyCode to initiate the access authorization. 
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## APIs and Integrations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I connect APIs?">
    Go to the [API Integration Guide](../guides/connect-APIs) for step-by-step instructions on adding popular APIs. EasyCode Flow has native integration with many 3rd party APIs like Supabase, OpenAI, and more. Stripe integration is coming soon!
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Are my API keys secure?">
    Yes! All API keys are stored locally and not shared with anyone else. EasyCode Agent will always store them server side so they are not exposed to the public.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What APIs are natively supported?">
    EasyCode Flow has native integrations with:
    - **Supabase**: Authentication, Database, realtime, etc.
    - **Stripe**: Coming soon! Everything payment related
    - **Popular APIs**: OpenAI, OpenRouter, Reddit, Anthropic, and more
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I don't see the integration I need">
    We're constantly adding new integrations! If you don't see a specific API or service you need:
    - **Stripe**: Payment integration is coming soon
    - **Other integrations**: Check back regularly as we add new native integrations
    - **Custom APIs**: You can still connect any REST API manually by adding your API keys and endpoints
    - **Feature requests**: Let us know what integrations you'd like to see via [Discord](https://discord.gg/3kqeNhsQxH) or [email](mailto:support@easycode.ai)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Debugging and Deployment

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="My deployment failed.">
    Make sure all linter errors and runtime errors are fixed before trying to deploy. 

    After fixing any remaining errors, initiate deployment again. 
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I'm stuck trying to fix an error">
    Use EasyCode Flow's debugging tools:
    - For compile/lint errors: Use the automatic quick fix prompts
    - For runtime errors: Click "Fix Error" in the Flow Diagram
    - For UI issues: Use Built-in Screenshot, Attach Image, or Element Selector
    - For unexpected behaviors: Use the Interactive Debugger when prompted
    
    Check the [Debugging Guide](../guides/debugging) for detailed instructions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between lint/compile errors and runtime errors?">
    - **Lint/compile errors** happen before your app runs (type checks, formatting issues, unused imports). EasyCode Flow displays these in the Chat Panel or App Preview.
    - **Runtime errors** happen during execution (unhandled exceptions, failed network requests). These appear in console logs and the Flow Diagram.
  </Accordion>
