The key to AI debugging is:

- knowing which type of error you have
- choosing the right tool/technique to fix it
- using AI debugging best practices

## General Best Practices

- use advanced models for bug fixing
- be specific when prompting the AI (use images, what's working, what's not working, etc)
- use checkpoints to create "backups" of your codebase
- if you notice the AI is getting stuck, revert to a previous checkpoint and try different approach

## Fix Lint/Compile Errors

Lint/compile errors happen before the execution of your app. It can be a failed type check, a formatting issue, an unused import, etc. 

You can easily spot lint/compile errors because EasyCode Flow runs lint and build checks after each edit, catch errors, and display them either in the **Chat Panel** or in the **App Preview**.

You will be prompted with a **automatic quick fix**. You can either Accept or Reject. 

<Tip>
  Some lint errors do not break your app's functionality. However, we recommend you try to fix them as they come up to prevent accumulation of errors.
</Tip>

## Fix Runtime Errors

Runtime errors happens during the execution of your app. It can be an unhandled exception, a failed network request, etc.

You can find them inside server side or client side console logs. To make things easier, EasyCode constantly checks for runtime errors in your logs and display them in the **Flow Diagram**.

To fix runtime errors:

- click **Fix Error** inside the Flow Diagram
- notice it injects runtimelogs into your Chat Context with pre-populated prompt
- submit chat

## Fix UI Issues

When trying to fix UI issues, provide as much details as possible. You can do so by:

- describe in detail via text
- provide an image using **Built-in Screenshot** or **Attach Image**
- specify the element using **Element Selector**

## Fix Unexpected Behaviors

Unlike lint or runtime errors, there may not be an explicit error message. Here is an exmaple:

**Expected Behavior**: Click button, modal opens up. \
**Actual Behavior**: Click button, nothing shows up. 

<Tip>
  Use the **Flow Diagram** to unerstand where things are failing. It could be in the front end, database, config or in a 3rd party library. Knowing this will help you prompt the AI better, significantly increasing the chance of fixing it.
</Tip>

To fix unexpected behaviors:

- describe **both** what is happening, and what you expect to happen. 
- provide runtime log when relevant 
- use **interactive debugger** if prompted

### Interactive Debugger

Once you describe the problem to the AI, EasyCode will automatically assess the situation and decide if **Interactive Debugger** should be activated. When activated, it will ask you to carry out the steps that cause the unexpected behavior.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Reproduce the problem">
    This can be simple such as clicking a button, or invovle multiple steps such as loggin in, navigating to a different page, providing some user input, and clicking a submit button. 
  </Step>
  <Step title="EasyCode records what's happening">
    As you take these steps, EasyCode will add logpoints inside the relevant functions, tracing code execution end-to-end to determine where things went wrong. 

    <Info>
      Log points are different from console logs, they do not pollute your code thus do not need to be removed. 
    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Reproduction Complete">
    EasyCode adds the relevant log data to context, and tries to fix the problem
  </Step>

## Optimal Debugging Workflow

As a rule of thumb, if you have accepted **automatic quick fix** suggestions more than 3 times, but one of the following situations are happening, you should reject further fix attempts, re-evaluate the error, athe same lint error

EasyCode has various tools to help you fix different errors & bugs:

- automatic quick fix
- runtime log debugging
- interactive debugging
