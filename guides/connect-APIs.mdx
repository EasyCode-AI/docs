3rd party APIs gives your app the additional capablities, for example you may want to:

- connect OpenAI API to build a chatbot.
- connect with Weather API to build a weather app.
- connect with Stripe to process payment. 

EasyCode Flow has **native integration** with many 3rd party APIs, this means that:

✅ easy to integrate - simply add the API keys

✅ already has access to the correct documentation

<Info>
  All API keys are stored locally and not shared with anyone elese. EasyCode Agent will always store them server side so they are not exposed to the public.
