EasyCode's **Planning Mode** can be triggered at 2 different levels:

- **Project level**: break down a large idea into features, user flows, API integrations etc. 
- **Feature level**: scope out a feature into techinical steps, with order of implementation. 

There are 2 ways to activate Planning Mode**:**

1. Automatic Mode
2. Manual Mode

<Tip>
  It's critical to take the time to **review AI generated plans**. \
  \
  Otherwise, there may be a difference between what you have in mind, and what the AI thinks you are trying to build - causing many issues during testing and validation. 
</Tip>

## Automatic Planning Mode

At the start of every new chat, including the very first prompt, EasyCode Agent will assess the complexity & vagueness of your prompt. 

If it deems the prompt is either too complex, or too vague, it will enter planning mode.

## Manual Planning Mode

To activte planning manually, simply tell the AI to

> Create a plan to \______\_

This will cause the AI to enter planning mode, and create a `plan.md` which you can modify directly or chat with the AI to modify.
